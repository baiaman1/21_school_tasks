## Chapter I
### Preamble
Robotics used to write all the source code from beginning to end in every new project. By the end of the project, they were tired and lost interest, so they spent most of their time writing bikes instead of focusing on their research. Therefore, modern robotics decided to write reference communication libraries so that they could be reused in every robot. 

## Chapter II
### Instructions
* Use this page as the only reference. Do not listen to any rumors and speculations about how to prepare your solution.
* Here and further we use ROS Melodic and C++.
* Pay attention to the permissions of your files and directories.
* To be assessed your solution must be in your GIT repository.
* Your solutions will be evaluated by your peers.
* You should not leave any additional file in your directory other than those explicitly specified in the subject. It is recommended that you modify your .gitignore to avoid accidents.
* When you need to get a precise output in your program, it is forbidden to display a precalculated output instead of performing the exercise correctly.
* Have a question? Ask your neighbor on the right. Otherwise, try your neighbor on the left.
* Your reference manual: peers / Internet / Google.
* You can ask questions in Slack.
* Read the examples carefully. They could very well call for details that are not explicitly mentioned in the subject...
* And may the Force be with you!

```console 
$ roscore
```

In the second, enter the command:
```console
$ rosrun turtlesim turtlesim_node
```

```console
$ rosrun turtlesim turtle_teleop_key
```

You should see this:
